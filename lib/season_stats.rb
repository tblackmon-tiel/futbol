  # something like comparing @team.team_id
  # and then replacing the instance of @game_teams.team_id to @team.team_name

  # either way, this method can be used for both methods below eventually, just have to
  # flesh out what that means for each season as well.
  # season is only listed in the games.csv so something like @game.season to compile
  # each seasons and then compare somehow the seasons with the game_id instances in
  # both @game and @game_teams.
