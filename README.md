## Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.


# - A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

- Our team plans to have regular Async check-ins in the morning and evening supplemented with 15 min huddle/zoom calls. We also plan to address any issues during the re-DTR to maintain our workflow.


# - A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

- Scrum (Tyler) assigning tasks and then if issues arise we can come together to go over them. We will be using Trello for the majority of task organization. We will also be utilizing GitHub Issues to point towards things that need creating, updating or fixing.


# - A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

- We are really aiming to ensure effective organization and management through our daily  check ins along with the work we are going to be assigned during our standup sessions. We really appreciate each team members strengths that we bring to the group and look forward to creating an outstanding project.

# - A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.

- Our approach to the projects code design is a combination of solo efforts through assigned work. We are going to leverage the experience of the people who feel comfortable with coding the more advanced methods and functions so that all team members can grow and not feel left behind or confused. 

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.

We did our retro on a trello board.

# - Top 3 things that went well during your project

1. Our ability to pivot quickly and efficiently. We've had 3-4 major pace changes and haven't ever really held things up. Although the initial plan hasn't been followed, we have continued to chug along and make progress. It's hard to see the progress in the code, but in terms of visualizing how the data all relates and how our different classes all relate, we've made huge progress.

2. Solving structures/design. We started simple and then advanced as we started to find patterns. It hasn't been all at once, but slowly over time realizing that not only are all the csv files related, but they're all using many different types of sports data to create new data for a sportsball. Even before we realized it all interelates, Tyler had a great visualization of how to get a parent class to work with the other three main classes.

3.  We had an excellent DTR and were able to build our team based on each others' strengths. We specifically talked out where everybody was at and made sure to reduce stress or fears of anybody being left in the dust or not being able to contribute as much as others. We were able to get tasks and a gameplan decided fairly quickly, as well as pair up members of the team that weren't as confident working async.

# - Top 3 things your team would do differently next time

1. Do a better job of making sure everyone is supported when technical needs are expressed. We were initially working with the assumption that the paired team was working on the easier methods, but in fact, were working on the ones with the most moving parts.

2. Don't let anyone beat their heads into a wall for too long.

3. Spend more time discussing and understanding the data as a group. While we did a lot of this, if we had spent more time in the beginning looking at how the csv files work with similar data, we may have caught that the SeasonStats  class was looking at bits of all three csv files whereas the other two classes, dealt with mostly just one csv.
